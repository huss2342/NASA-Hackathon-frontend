## User Experience
- **Interactive narrative gameplay** with branching decision points
- **Real-time data visualizations** of NASA satellite measurements
- **Educational feedback system** that explains the impact of each choice
- **Progressive difficulty** across multiple farm management scenarios

## Game Flow
Players face scenarios requiring interpretation of:
- Soil moisture levels for irrigation decisions
- Precipitation risk for flood management
- Surface temperature for heat stress mitigation
- Vegetation health indices for pest/disease control

Each decision directly affects farm resources (water, money, time) and determines whether players can secure the bank loan and save the farm.
